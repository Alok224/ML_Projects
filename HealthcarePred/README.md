# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting Parkinson's Disease using machine learning techniques based on specific biomarkers. Parkinson's is a **progressive neurological disorder** that affects movement. Early signs include **stiffness, tremors**, and **slowed motion**.

While there is no single, certain diagnostic test, machine learning can be a powerful tool to assist in prediction and early detection.
