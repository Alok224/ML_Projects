🎬 Movie Revenue Prediction (ML Project)
🧠 Objective
This project uses Linear Regression to predict a movie’s box office revenue based on historical data. It also compares performance with advanced models like XGBoost to evaluate prediction accuracy.

📂 Key Features
1.Predict movie revenue before release

2.Analyze which features impact box office success

3.Compare Linear Regression vs. XGBoost

🔧 Workflow
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Feature Engineering

* Visualization & Insights

* Model Training (Linear Regression)

* Model Evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)

* Model Comparison (XGBoost)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📌 Outcome
Linear Regression gives baseline predictions

XGBoost improves accuracy on complex patterns

Key insights: budget, popularity, genre significantly impact revenue
