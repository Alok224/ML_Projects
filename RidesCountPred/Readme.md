🚕 RideaRequest – Ride Fare Prediction Project
🧠 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict ride fares based on multiple dynamic factors like time, location, and demand — just like apps such as Ola and Uber do.

📚 Background
Ever noticed how you pay more or less for the same ride on different days? That’s due to surge pricing, which is affected by factors like:

1. Time of day

2. Ride demand in the area

3. Distance & route

4. Weather or special events

5. This project aims to model such real-world conditions to predict ride prices effectively.

🔧 Workflow
1. Data Collection & Cleaning

2. Feature Extraction (hour, distance, demand zones, etc.)

3. Model Building (Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.)

4. Performance Evaluation (RMSE, R²)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Outcome
Built a model to predict ride fare dynamically

Identified key factors like time, distance, and demand level that affect pricing.
